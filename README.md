# 🌌 HoloGen // Neural Image Synthesis

> **Transform 2D visuals into interactive 3D landscapes with neural displacement.**

HoloGen is a high-performance 3D visualization engine built for the web. It utilizes advanced displacement mapping and real-time PBR (Physically Based Rendering) to "sculpt" depth from brightness, all wrapped in a high-fidelity cyberpunk aesthetic.

## ✨ Core Matrix

- 🛡️ **Neural Displacement**: Transform image luminance into topological 3D depth maps.
- 📐 **Dynamic Geometry**: Real-time control over mesh density and displacement scale.
- ⚡ **Turbo Render**: Optimized WebGL execution via Three.js & React Three Fiber.
- 🎨 **Aesthetic Overdrive**: Premium Glassmorphism UI with Bloom and Post-Processing effects.
- 📸 **Neural Capture**: High-resolution PNG export of the synthesized 3D scenes.
